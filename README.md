Pinexz is a decentralized Ethereum Token Exchange with the most ERC20 listings of any exchange.


# What is Pinexz?
Pinexz currently acts as an open source, updated interface for EtherDelta's smart contract with an active and public development team. Although Pinexz started as a fork of EtherDelta, considerable development time has been put towards a new token listing system, order book, API, and front-end UI all of which are at different stages of development and can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/pinexz/). 


# How does Pinexz Work?
Pinexz currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract (described in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6kdiyl/smart_contract_overview/)) which allows Pinexz users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume.
